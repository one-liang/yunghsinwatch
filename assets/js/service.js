    "As the second-generation leader of Yung Hsin Watch Co., Henry Lai approaches the world of haute horlogerie with a deep sense of gratitude and humility. He believes that the true value of luxury watch retail extends far beyond the timepiece itself—it lies in the trust built over time. Through sincere, personal interactions, much like those shared between friends or family, Henry strives to establish lasting and meaningful relationships with clients.\nThis commitment to long-term value also reflects the spirit of “tradition” that Henry admires in Patek Philippe. From watchmaking craftsmanship and client service to after-sales care and maintenance, the emphasis remains on quality and values accumulated over time, rather than fleeting market trends. To Henry, what Yung Hsin Watch Co. carries forward is not simply a watchmaking business, but a legacy rooted in time, trust, and craftsmanship.\nAs the watch industry continues to evolve, Henry observes that “our values shape our sense of aesthetics.” To him, a timepiece is more than a collectible; it reflects an individual’s taste, personality, and life choices. Guided by the philosophy, “Connect first, build trust, then do business,” Henry hopes to engage with collectors beyond the mainstream perspectives shaped by market trends and social media—helping them rediscover the pure joy of collecting and choose timepieces that truly resonate with their own taste.",

True trust is never established overnight; it is built gradually through genuine care and meaningful interactions over time.\nKnown for his warm and deeply loyal personality, Leo lives by a simple belief: “When someone treats you well, always give back even more.” He keeps in mind the collectors who have supported Yung Hsin throughout the years, cherishing every relationship and every trust placed in his hands. Looking ahead, he remains committed to the same passion and sincerity, nurturing each connection and doing his best to support every client who chooses Yung Hsin.",

    "With nearly two decades of experience at Yung Hsin Watch Co., senior sales consultant Jay Chien has remained deeply passionate about haute horlogerie. His journey into the watch industry began with a genuine interest and love for fine timepieces, a passion that has grown over the years into deep professional expertise. Whenever brands introduce new releases, Jay is eager to stay abreast of the latest developments in watchmaking technology and design, turning what he learns into an enjoyable exchange with clients.\nFor Jay, one of Patek Philippe’s greatest appeals lies in its ability to balance heritage with innovation. Its rich family history and tradition of independent ownership allow the brand to preserve its legacy while continually pushing the boundaries of watchmaking. When working with knowledgeable and discerning collectors, Jay builds trust through expertise and long-term companionship. Taking each collector’s needs and collecting journey into consideration, he guides them from classic timepieces toward more functional, highly complicated, and ultimately exceptional collector’s pieces, accompanying them as their collections evolve. Looking ahead, Jay hopes to continue deepening his expertise and elevating the quality of his service, growing alongside Yung Hsin Watch Co. and the brands it represents, while sharing the enduring fascination of fine watchmaking with more watch enthusiasts.",

    "With more than eleven years of experience in haute horlogerie, including his time serving at Yung Hsin Watch Co.’s Patek Philippe boutique, Carl Kao has remained deeply passionate about mechanical craftsmanship and committed to continuous learning. Through independent research and professional training, he has developed a strong foundation of expertise, allowing him to study each timepiece in depth and explain its value in a clear and accessible way. His approach combines professional knowledge with a genuine warmth, providing clients with thoughtful and personalized consultation.\nDeeply aligned with Patek Philippe’s spirit of independent watchmaking and exceptional craftsmanship, Carl feels a strong sense of responsibility in conveying the values behind the brand. He believes that a mechanical watch is more than a timekeeping instrument—it represents craftsmanship, personal taste, and individuality. With each client’s needs at the heart of his service philosophy, he strives to provide the most thorough and attentive experience possible. Looking ahead, Carl will continue to deepen his expertise with the dedication of a true craftsman, helping each client discover a timepiece that is uniquely their own.",
  "team.member.elmoWang.bio":
    "With a background in luxury fashion retail, Elmo Wang brings his refined aesthetic sensibility and extensive client-service experience into the world of haute horlogerie, creating a distinctive professional advantage. He values communication that is efficient, concise, and precise. Recognizing that watchmaking is a profound and highly specialized field, he believes the role of a professional consultant is to translate complex movements, design concepts, and brand stories into clear and accessible language. In doing so, clients can not only appreciate the craftsmanship behind each timepiece, but also discover the pleasure of exploring watches and develop a deeper connection with and trust in the brand.\nAmid fluctuating market prices and the pursuit of sought-after models, Elmo’s advice to clients remains simple and direct: “What matters most is that you love it.” He believes collecting should not be dictated by market prices or passing trends. Only a timepiece that one genuinely loves can provide lasting emotional satisfaction and companionship. This grounded approach reflects his belief in the purest essence of watch retail: helping each client choose a timepiece they truly love and enjoy the genuine pleasure of collecting.",
  "team.member.dorisChen.bio":
    "With a background in watch media, Doris Chen turned her passion for horology into a career in watch retail, transitioning from media to become a professional sales consultant. Drawing on the expertise she developed through her previous work, she creates a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere for clients while offering thoughtful and in-depth insights into each timepiece. “I hope to help clients understand that what they are purchasing is not simply a watch, but a piece of value truly worth owning.”\nAfter joining Patek Philippe, Doris gained an even deeper appreciation for one of the brand’s most iconic messages: “You never actually own a Patek Philippe. You merely look after it for the next generation.” To her, this is far more than a slogan—it is something she has witnessed in real life. Many highly accomplished clients choose their timepieces with the intention of eventually passing them on to their children, spouses, or other family members. With more than two centuries of history behind it, Doris believes that Patek Philippe’s enduring craftsmanship and timeless appeal are precisely what give each timepiece its lasting significance as a legacy to be passed from one generation to the next.",
  "team.member.phoebeChen.bio":
    "With a background in finance, Phoebe Chen sees a fine timepiece as far more than a way of measuring time. To her, a high-end watch embodies a brand’s history, design aesthetics, and the wearer’s personal taste. From the meticulous finishing of individual components to the complexity of its mechanical construction, every detail reflects the accumulated expertise of traditional watchmaking. The timepiece a client chooses to wear can also reveal much about their personal style and approach to life.\nWhen serving discerning clients, Phoebe believes that sincerity and professionalism are the keys to building trust. She always puts herself in the client’s position, using genuine communication and thoughtful consideration to bridge the distance and build lasting relationships. In an age when information is readily available online, she also sees an important role for the sales consultant in helping clients set realistic expectations. Through professional and transparent communication, she aims to help clients truly understand the spirit and values behind each brand, ensuring that every timepiece they choose is based on genuine understanding and trust.",
  "team.member.jessieJiang.bio":
    "With years of experience in the world of fine watchmaking, Jessie Jiang has built extensive frontline expertise and developed a deep understanding of collectors’ needs and aspirations at different stages of their collecting journeys. For clients visiting a luxury watch boutique for the first time, she creates a warm and natural atmosphere that puts them at ease, taking the time to listen to their preferences and thoughts on collecting. For Jessie, genuine understanding is the foundation of meaningful service—only by truly understanding each client can she offer the right recommendations and accompany them as they gradually build a collection of their own.\nJessie has also witnessed the true meaning of Patek Philippe’s spirit of heritage and generational continuity. At Yung Hsin Watch Co., the idea of passing a Patek Philippe from one generation to the next is not simply a brand message, but a story that unfolds in real life every day. Many longtime clients who purchased their watches here decades ago now return with cherished timepieces for servicing and maintenance, hoping to preserve these timeless classics for their children, and even future generations. This has shaped Jessie’s vision of service: not only to accompany collectors today, but to remain a trusted watch advisor for their families for ten, twenty, or even many more years, allowing the emotions and values carried by each timepiece to endure through time.",

  "service.faq.q1": "Mechanical Watch Servicing & Lubrication",
  "service.faq.a1.p1":
    "How often should a mechanical watch be serviced? This is a question that concerns many watch owners. Even when a watch is currently keeping accurate time, the precision escapement components and jewel bearings inside the movement require proper lubrication. In general, most mechanical watches should be serviced approximately every 3–5 years, although the actual interval should be determined based on wearing frequency, timekeeping performance, and test results.",
  "service.faq.a1.p2":
    "The recommended service interval may vary depending on how often the watch is worn, the environment in which it is used, and the condition of the movement. If the watch is worn every day or exposed to relatively demanding conditions, servicing may be required sooner. If it is worn less frequently and remains in good working condition, the interval may be extended.",

  "service.faq.q2": "Magnetism & Mechanical Watches",
  "service.faq.a2.p1":
    "There are many potential sources of magnetic fields in everyday life. A watch that remains close to a strong magnetic field for an extended period may be affected. Magnetization can cause a watch to gain time suddenly or experience abnormal timekeeping.",
  "service.faq.a2.p2":
    "If a watch suddenly begins gaining significantly or shows other unusual timekeeping behavior, magnetization should be considered in addition to a possible movement malfunction. The watch should be inspected by a professional watchmaker. After demagnetization, timekeeping accuracy can be significantly improved.",

  "service.faq.q3": "Basic Water Resistance",
  "service.faq.a3.p1":
    "A watch's water resistance mainly relies on the gaskets located around components such as the crown and case back. Basic everyday water resistance of 30 meters can generally withstand minor splashes or rain. However, actual performance can also be affected by factors such as water pressure, hand movement, temperature, and the aging of the water-resistance gaskets.",
  "service.faq.a3.p2":
    "Because water-resistance gaskets inevitably wear over time, prolonged use or leaving a watch unused for an extended period may cause the gaskets to lose elasticity and sealing performance. Therefore, even if a watch was originally water-resistant, it should not be considered permanently water-resistant.",
  "service.faq.a3.p3":
    "If you are unsure about the current water-resistance condition of your watch, avoid wearing it while showering or swimming. In particular, warm water produces small water-vapor molecules that can more easily penetrate the watch and cause internal damage.",

  "service.faq.q4": "Wearing Guide for Hand-Wound Watches",
  "service.faq.a4.p1":
    "Because hand-wound watches contain precision mechanical components, if you notice significant resistance or a rough, uneven sensation while winding the watch, or if the automatic winding system or movement produces unusual sounds, this may indicate a problem with the mainspring system, gears, bearings, crown tube, or related lubrication points.",
  "service.faq.a4.p2":
    "These signs can be regarded as an initial indication that the watch should be inspected. You can monitor the condition of your watch by paying attention to the winding sensation, sounds from the automatic winding system, and the operating sounds of the movement.",

  "service.faq.q5": "Basic Daily Watch Care",
  "service.faq.a5.p1":
    "During everyday wear, it is recommended to regularly use a soft, dry cloth to remove dust, perspiration, moisture, and foreign particles from the watch. Avoid impacts and collisions whenever possible. These are among the simplest and lowest-risk ways to care for your watch on a daily basis.",

  // 英文版內文在設計稿是兩個自然段，靠 \n 換行（HTML 用 whitespace-pre-line 呈現）。
  "service.faq.a6.leather.body":
    "Because perspiration contains salts and other chemical substances, prolonged contact with leather may cause deterioration. A simple way to care for a leather strap is to apply leather conditioning oil with a clean, soft cloth and gently wipe the strap.\nThe metal buckle on a leather strap can be gently cleaned with a toothbrush and soapy water. Be careful not to get the leather wet. After cleaning, dry the buckle promptly with a dry cloth. If you tend to perspire heavily, try to avoid wearing a leather strap during activities that cause excessive sweating, and regularly wipe the inside of the strap.",
  "service.faq.a6.metal.label": "Metal Bracelets:",
  "service.faq.a6.metal.body":
    "Metal bracelets can be cleaned with water. When dirt is more stubborn, soak the bracelet in soapy water or a mild neutral detergent diluted with water, then gently brush it with a soft toothbrush.\nTake care to avoid getting the watch case wet, as this could affect its performance. After cleaning, carefully dry the bracelet with a dry cloth to prevent moisture from remaining in the gaps between the links.",
  "service.faq.a6.fabric.label": "Fabric Straps:",
  "service.faq.a6.fabric.body":

  "service.faq.a6.gold.label": "18K Gold Bracelets:",
  "service.faq.a6.gold.body":
    "Because gold is relatively soft, an 18K gold polishing cloth can generally be used for cleaning. It can remove dirt as well as oxidation marks from the surface. If the bracelet is heavily soiled, it can also be soaked in soapy water for cleaning.",
  "service.faq.a6.special":
    "For straps or bracelets made from special materials, consult a professional watch retailer or watchmaker for appropriate care and maintenance.",

  "service.faq.q7": "Watch Servicing & Inspection",
  "service.faq.a7.p1":
    "The servicing and repair process will be arranged according to the specific requirements of each watch. Service procedures may include external inspection, review of service records, movement disassembly, component inspection, cleaning and lubrication, reassembly, installation of the dial and hands, case polishing and cleaning, water-resistance testing, casing-up, and final testing of timekeeping accuracy and water resistance.",

  "service.faq.a1.p1":
    "多久要洗油保養？是錶主非常關心的問題，即使目前走時正常，機芯內精密的擒縱結構與寶石軸承需要適當潤滑。一般而言，多數機械錶的洗油保養週期約為 3～5年，但仍要配合佩戴頻率、走時狀況與測試數據判斷。實際週期會受到佩戴頻率、使用環境與機芯狀況影響。如果每天佩戴、使用環境較複雜，可能需要提早保養；若佩戴頻率低、運作狀況良好，週期則可以延長。",

  "service.faq.q2": "機械錶防磁知識",
  "service.faq.a2.p1":
    "生活中存在不少磁場來源，腕錶若長時間接近強磁場，都可能受到影響。腕錶受磁可能造成腕錶突然走快、走時異常。若腕錶突然出現不尋常的明顯快走或走時異常，除了考慮機芯故障，可以考慮是否曾接觸強磁場，並交由專業鐘錶維修師檢測。腕錶經過消磁處理後，可大幅減少走時誤差。",
  "service.faq.a2.p2": "",

  "service.faq.q3": "腕錶基礎防水",
  "service.faq.a3.p1":
    "腕錶的防水主要依靠錶冠、底蓋等位置的防水膠圈。一般30米的日常基礎防水，遇到少量潑水或下雨狀況，可保有防水功能，實際使用還會受到水流、手部動作、溫度與防水膠圈老化等因素影響。由於手錶的防水圈在長期使用後難免有損耗，膠圈長時間使用或放置過久，都可能出現彈性疲乏、密合度下降的情況，因此即使腕錶原本具有防水性能，也不能認為它永久防水。在不清楚錶款本身的防水狀態之前，需避免戴手錶洗澡或游泳。尤其是溫熱水的水蒸氣分子小，容易滲入造成內部損壞。",

// 極簡 i18n runtime（沒有用任何套件，就是把 data-i18n 的文字換掉）。
//
// - 字典由 i18n-zh.js / i18n-en.js 掛在 window.SITE_I18N 上，載入順序不拘，
//   因為這支只在 DOM ready 之後才讀字典。
// - 文字節點用 data-i18n="<key>"；屬性用 data-i18n-attr="aria-label:<key>"（可逗號分隔多組）。
// - 選中的語系寫進 localStorage，並同步 <html lang>，讓 tailwind.css 的 `en:` variant 生效。
//
// 已知取捨：builder 只在 </body> 前注入一支 script，所以上次選英文的訪客
// 重新整理時會有一瞬間看到 HTML 原始的中文。要消除就得讓 builder 支援 <head> 內的
// inline script，目前不值得為此改架構。

//   - 按鈕的 aria-expanded：圖示的 ＋／✕ 切換（group-aria-expanded）
//   - 面板的 data-open：展開動畫（data-open:grid-rows-[1fr]）
//
// 展開動畫用 grid-template-rows 0fr → 1fr，高度交給瀏覽器算，不必在 JS 量 scrollHeight，
// 內容換語系（中英文段落數不同）後也不會算錯。收合時 visibility 會在動畫結束後才變成
// hidden，所以收合狀態下的內容不會被鍵盤或螢幕閱讀器讀到。
